# :seedling: Plant Parenthood :seedling:
## A Secure IoT Plant Sensor Application

Tess Lameyer, Lisa Carpenter, Ian Andrewson, Alan Hermanns, Ben Beekman

## DESCRIPTION

Plant Parenthood is a secure server-side application that allows users to remotely gather and post data collected from a variety of sensors (light, temperature, humidity) via a Raspberry Pi.  Two-factor authentication ensures the integrity of data.  Data can be interpreted to make recommendations of common house plants that may thrive under matching environmental conditions.

## PROBLEM DOMAIN

There are many kits avaiable on the market that make it possible to monitor environmental conditions for house plants.  However, the market lacks an application that caters plant recommendations to users based on baseline environmental conditions.  This application aims to fill this gap, providing a secure, simple way to collect data remotely pertaining to the light, temperature, and humidity at a specific location.  These environmental indicators can then be used to customize plant recommendations for each user.

## RAPBERRY PI CONFIGURATION
- See https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up for more detailed information about installing the Raspbian OS on a Raspberry Pi 4 

  - Download the NOOBS operating system from [The Raspberry Pi NOOBS download page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) to the root level of a formatted MicroSD card.  
  - Eject the Micro SD card from your computer and insert it into the Raspberry Pi.
  - Connect a display, keyboard, mouse, and power supply to your Raspberry Pi.
  - After booting into Raspbian, complete the prompts, setting a non-default password for Raspberry Pi.
  - Follow prompts to update the Raspberry Pi's software.
  - Execute `sudo raspi-config` in a Raspberry Pi terminal
    - Navigate to *Network Options: Hostname* to change the hostname.
    - Navigate to *Interfacing Options*
      - Enable SSH - this will allow secure, remote access to your Raspberry Pi. 
      - For photoresistor (light), enable SPI.
      - For Adafruit TSL-2591, enable I2C.
  - Restart the device using `sudo reboot`.

## SENSOR HARDWARE AND SETUP
### Light
Required Hardware
  - 10KOhm resistor
